        <title>Storyboarding</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After creating a shot list with the group, I worked with Justin to take photos and combine them into a rough storyboard of the types of shots we wanted for our documentary. I tried to come up with shots I thought would work well with Dr. Riecke’s story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/storyboard-pg-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Storyboard page 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/storyboard-pg-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Storyboard page 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drew a storyboard to plan for my individual project as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/individual-storyboard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Individual project storyboard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also created a storyboard to plan what things we were going to shoot inside the iSpace lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/storyboard-lab.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Storyboard for iSpace lab&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storyboarding helped my team and I to have a plan of what we needed to do before getting on location. I learned that sometimes you still have to improvise based on things that change once you arrive on location, like finding out that the camera won’t fit in certain spaces you though it would, or the lighting is different than you anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- [Jekyll][jekyll] is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. Here is a little quote from the official website:

&gt; It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through [Markdown][markdown] (or [Textile][textile]) and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind [GitHub Pages][github-pages], which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.

        <title>Lighting Workshop</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the in-class workshop today, we reviewed how to create a basic three-point lighting setup using a small and large lighting kit, as well as reflectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/3-point-small.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Using small 3 point lighting kit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/reflector.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Using a reflector&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then looked at lighting a green screen, and how distance from the screen can reduce spill onto the subject. Reviewing how to setup all the stands, wiring, and lights was very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
