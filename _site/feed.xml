        <title>Final Group Project: VR and Architecture Documentary</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/HfnLg-IhAuc?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My group of four, including myself, created this documentary to illustrate a research project at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfu.ca&quot;&gt;Simon Fraser University&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfu.ca/siat&quot;&gt;SIAT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://ispace.iat.sfu.ca&quot;&gt;iSpace labs&lt;/a&gt;. The project explores how architectural design processes can be enhanced by virtual reality. My group members were Linda Nguyen, Jason Chen, and Justin Poon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the pre-production process of storyboarding, meeting with our interviewees, finding locations, and preparing to shoot, we started by filming the interviews. I ran at least one of the cameras for both interviews, while Linda did the sound, Justin managed another camera, and Jason monitored the sound. I also set up the lavalier microphones for each shoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/scouting-smaller.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Scouting a location with Jake&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we interviewed Jacob Freiburg, we had to switch between three different cameras, which unfortunately resulted in different looking footage from each. I colour corrected to the more bluish-green footage for the final submission in this course, which I will fix for the next iterations of the video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/jake-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jake interview shot 1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/jake-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Jake interview shot 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used natural lighting for both interviews, to show our subjects in the context of a building with modern architecture. I also had to colour correct the footage from two cameras for the interview with Dr. Riecke a little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/bernhard-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bernhard interview shot 1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/bernhard-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bernhard interview shot 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we shot the interviews, we shot the footage of Dr. Riecke and Jacob demonstrating the virtual reality equipment in their iSpace lab, using the storyboards I drew. I directed and operated one of the cameras most of the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/ispace-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Me shooting the silhouette shot in the iSpace lab&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/ispace-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Me shooting in the iSpace lab&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was challenging to shoot in such low lighting conditions, but we made do, since we wanted to show both the users of the system and the display simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/ispace-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Shooting in the iSpace lab&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the interviews and lab footage were done, I helped shoot more b-roll of different modern buildings, an architectural model, people moving through various spaces, and context shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/linda-filming-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Filming B-roll 1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/linda-filming-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Filming B-roll 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I edited a rough cut of the film to show to Dr. Riecke and Jacob about a week before the final presentation in class. I found that editing a documentary was much more work than narrative films I had done before. Going through multiple hours of interviews to try to construct an interesting story in five minutes was very challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/premiere-timeline.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Premiere timeline&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Linda edited the film according to the feedback we received from Dr. Riecke and Jacob, I helped put finishing touches on the final presentation version of the film. I did some colour correction, helped with the dynamic typography, and made some other minor adjustments. We were working right up to the last minute!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/last-minute-editing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Last minute editing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think our presentation went well and I am fairly happy with the film. I definitely learned a lot about working with a client, and trying something I’ve never done before like making a documentary. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Individual Project: The Bus Stop</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/pUo4qBW0UTA?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When creating my individual project, I knew we were required to use a chroma keying effect, so I tried to create a short comedy narrative, since I had experience doing that type of film. I wanted to use the effect to add something funny to my film, so I came up with this idea after watching this Film Riot episode:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bqIEnkwd54s?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created my own green screen by taping together some neon paper from the dollar store. This way, it was somewhat portable, and I could use it outside to get the same lighting as the rest of my shots. Unfortunately, not all of my subject fit onto the green screen, so I had to rotoscope a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/individual-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Green screen before&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/individual-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Green screen after&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In post-production, I added letterboxing to make the film appear more cinematic, and also added some contrast and saturation to give the film a happier and more playful feel, since I shot in a flat picture style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/individual-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Marcus close up before&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/individual-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Marcus close up after&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recorded sound with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://tascam.com/product/dr-05/&quot;&gt;Tascam DR-05&lt;/a&gt;. Here is the storyboard I drew for the project: &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Rehearsal Footage</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After creating the storyboards, we practiced some lighting techniques and camera angles for shots we planned to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one shot, we tried getting a tracking shot by placing the camera and tripod on a rolling chair, and pushing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/rehearsal-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rolling the tripod and camera 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/rehearsal-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rolling the tripod and camera 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also tried a three-point lighting setup in case we couldn’t find a location to interview with good natural lighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/rehearsal-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3 point lighting set-up&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the final shots from our rehearsal footage. We tried to implement what we learned in the workshops to improve our shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/rehearsal-shot-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Final rehearsal shot 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/rehearsal-shot-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Final rehearsal shot 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating rehearsal footage helped us realize what we needed to improve on for the actual interviews and other shoots for our final project. For example, we realized that we should use a slider instead of a rolling chair for tracking shots. We also found that keeping the camera steady in general was no easy task without proper equipment, and that even basic 3 point lighting can take a while to set up.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lecture Workshop</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In one of the lectures, my team and I had the chance to see other groups practice some lighting setups, and also practice lighting one silhouette shot for our own project. We got feedback, got some new lighting ideas from our peers, and learned how to improve the placement of lights, and the overall look of various setups.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Storyboarding</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After creating a shot list with the group, I worked with Justin to take photos and combine them into a rough storyboard of the types of shots we wanted for our documentary. I tried to come up with shots I thought would work well with Dr. Riecke’s story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/storyboard-pg-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Storyboard page 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/storyboard-pg-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Storyboard page 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drew a storyboard to plan for my individual project as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/individual-storyboard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Individual project storyboard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also created a storyboard to plan what things we were going to shoot inside the iSpace lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/storyboard-lab.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Storyboard for iSpace lab&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storyboarding helped my team and I to have a plan of what we needed to do before getting on location. I learned that sometimes you still have to improvise based on things that change once you arrive on location, like finding out that the camera won’t fit in certain spaces you though it would, or the lighting is different than you anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lighting Workshop</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the in-class workshop today, we reviewed how to create a basic three-point lighting setup using a small and large lighting kit, as well as reflectors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/3-point-small.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Using small 3 point lighting kit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/iat344-film-blog/assets/img/reflector.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Using a reflector&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then looked at lighting a green screen, and how distance from the screen can reduce spill onto the subject. Reviewing how to setup all the stands, wiring, and lights was very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
