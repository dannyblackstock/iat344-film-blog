When creating my individual project, I knew we were required to use a chroma keying effect, so I tried to create a short comedy narrative, since I had experience doing that type of film. I wanted to use the effect to add something funny to my film, so I came up with this idea after watching this Film Riot episode:

I created my own green screen by taping together some neon paper from the dollar store. This way, it was somewhat portable, and I could use it outside to get the same lighting as the rest of my shots. Unfortunately, not all of my subject fit onto the green screen, so I had to rotoscope a little bit.

In post-production, I added letterboxing to make the film appear more cinematic, and also added some contrast and saturation to give the film a happier and more playful feel, since I shot in a flat picture style.

I recorded sound with my [Tascam DR-05][tascam]. Here is the storyboard I drew for the project:
