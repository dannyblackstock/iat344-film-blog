After creating the storyboards, we practiced some lighting techniques and camera angles for shots we planned to do.

For one shot, we tried getting a tracking shot by placing the camera and tripod on a rolling chair, and pushing it.

We also tried a three-point lighting setup in case we couldn't find a location to interview with good natural lighting.

Here are some of the final shots from our rehearsal footage. We tried to implement what we learned in the workshops to improve our shots.

Creating rehearsal footage helped us realize what we needed to improve on for the actual interviews and other shoots for our final project. For example, we realized that we should use a slider instead of a rolling chair for tracking shots. We also found that keeping the camera steady in general was no easy task without proper equipment, and that even basic 3 point lighting can take a while to set up.
